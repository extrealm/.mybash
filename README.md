.mybash
=======

This is for my life get easier and concurrent. 
-- by replicating my prefered bash options after installing Linux, Cygwin, or Git Bash, etc.

Just clone repo into home dir:

    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/extrealm/.mybash

then source it:

    source ~/.mybash/bashrc.home

or alter home's defaults, create `.bashrc` if not exist.

    cp ~/.mybash/bashrc.home ~/.bashrc

I didn't used dot prefix as already hidden by repo name.

Someday, I may use different config per platform using `branch` or tracked `tag`.
